For me it is very common that people are often
asking what i use as a software developer to keep
everything in place. So this page may respond to
some of your questions.

I'll do my best to explain and keep this up to
date with my current setup.

## Daily Driver (Desktop) ## {#daily-driver}

Most of the time, I rely on this trusty desktop PC
for all my development work. Despite entering my
life back in the 2010s, making it somewhat dated
by today's standards, this machine continues to
perform admirably.
