Hello, as you may already know, I'm Felipe Farias,
residing in Chile, and I have a deep passion for
any kind of technology.

Since I made Linux my daily driver, I've undergone
significant changes in my workflow, adopting a
more minimalistic mindset overall. I frequently
practice digital minimalism, striving to declutter
my workspaces and tools.

### music

For me, music is an essential part of my daily
routine, both as a software developer and a
regular gym-goer. It adds rhythm to my work and
energizes my workouts.

My tastes are varied ranging from _Rap_, _Metal_,
_Techno_, _Classical_, etc

Here are some Spotify playlists that I frequently enjoy:

- [Jazz Hip Hop (chill)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1KHla86iONZm5BrJwdKU7H)
- [Too Angry To Die. [ HEAVY ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4a4ZRlzCBQ8Upwc7PhOeKI)
- [ZARA (my favorite)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/40OHRWDv5yVLQXQcfkcJma)
