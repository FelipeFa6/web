### Active Projects

- [httpd](https://github.com/FelipeFa6/httpd) (2023 - present) (C)
    - HTTP server with small memory footprint.

- [felipefarias.xyz](https://felipefarias.xyz) (2022 - present)
    - Began with _HTML_, shifted to _Next.js_ but
      found it wasn't my style. Now, it uses
      _HUGO_ on _GitHub Pages_.

### Completed / Abandoned Projects

- [Coolebra](https://coolebra.com/) (2022 - 2023) (Next.JS)
    - Coolebra was my first full-time job as a
      fullstack developer where I worked with a
      team of 3 more developers.

- [cdwn](https://github.com/FelipeFa6/cdwn) (2023) (C)
